## TODO

### okay, here are some thoughts on the vision of this application:

- poll spaceflightnow every 15 min using this program hosted on AWS
- push out new launches to all devices (w/ option to unsub), and changes to a
  launch to any upcoming launch that a user is subscribed to
- show reddit-style 'cards' view, w/ launch name, date, vehicle, and expand to
  see details / site etc.
- search for launches based on location / vehicle / date range, combined
- scrape the launch log as well for users to search through
- maybe add a feature showing a google maps tile of upcoming launches globally?
  or a heatmap of upcoming launch locations, or heatmap of all launches back to
  2004?
- include an image or info on launch vehicle provided by wikipedia when
  possible
- need to put in some work to figure out notification framework...
- when subscribed to a launch, give option to set reminder for day before,
  custom time before, etc, or even sync it to Google calendar!
- need to put in provisions for bogus launch values, like TBD
